# TASKLIST - Angular Senior CT

With this application, you will be able to organize yourself more efficiently. Add tasks with a description and manage their status in a comfortable and visual manner.
By default, the task list will be empty. Start by adding a new task to explore the functionality of the application.


# Installation

 1. Install **@angular/cli "~15.1.4"**
 2. Install **NodeJS**
 3. Install all dependencies using `npm install`
 4. Install Jest using `npm install --save-dev jest jest-preset-angular @types/jest`
 5. Open the repository in the code editor of your choice.
 6. Launch the application using  `npm run start`
 7. Launch the mock server using  `npm run server`


# Usage


## Create new task

Fill out the form to create a new task. It will be automatically added to the list with the status **'pending'** (red coloured).

## Delete task

You can delete a task by **clicking on the trash icon that appears on the right side** of it when the mouse is hovered over.

## Mark task as complete / return to pending

You can toggle the task's status by **clicking on the circle located on the right side of it**. If the task is currently marked as pending, it will be moved to the end of the list. On the other hand, if it was marked as completed and you want to change it back to pending, clicking on the checkbox will return it to the 'pending' status.

## Filters

You can filter the tasks according to their status, **choosing to display only the ones you have selected using the buttons designed for this purpose** (show all, show pending, show completed).

## Task counter

You can keep track of the pending tasks and the total number of tasks. **This is achieved through the counter located at the top of the application**, which will monitor the task count in real-time.
